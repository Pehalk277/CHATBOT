# ðŸ¤– Jarves - Simple Python Chatbot

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is Task 3 of my internship project, where I created a simple **rule-based chatbot** using Python and the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library.

The chatbot, named **Jarves**, is designed to respond to basic user inputs like greetings, name inquiries, and farewells using predefined pattern-response pairs.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Rule-based conversational responses
- Uses `nltk.chat.util.Chat` for pattern matching
- Responds to:
  - Greetings (hi, hello)
  - Identity questions (What's your name?)
  - Small talk (How are you?)
  - Farewells (bye)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Install NLTK**:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
